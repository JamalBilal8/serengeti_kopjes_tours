                                    Mount Kilimanjaro is one of the largest volcanoes in the world. It has three main volcanic peaks, Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. 
                                    With its snow-capped peak and glaciers, it is the highest mountain in Africa. The mountain has five main vegetation zones from the lowest to the highest point
                                    Lower slopes, montane forest, heath and moorland, alpine desert and summit. The whole mountain including the montane forest belt is very rich in species, 
                                    in particular mammals, 
                                    many of them endangered species.  For this combination of features but mostly its height, its physical form and snow cap and its isolation above the surrounding plains, 
                                    Mount Kilimanjaro is considered an outstanding example of a superlative natural phenomenon.

                                        The wildlife of the property is important to the experience of Kilimanjaro, although the property is not inscribed in relation to biodiversity criteria.Pressures on elephant, buffalo and antelope,
                                         and logging in the Forest Reserve area, were noted as integrity concerns at the time of inscription. The park is connected to Amboseli National Park, however corridors to Arusha National Park and 
                                        Tsavo National park have been encroached, impacting on wildlife migration.

                                        Numerous mammals, many of them endangered species, live in the park.

                                        The park is known worldwide for its abundance of wildlife and high biodiversity.
                                        The migratory - and some resident - wildebeest, which number over 1.5 million individuals, 
                                        constitute the largest population of big mammals that still roam the planet. They are joined in their journey through the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem by 200,000 plains zebra, 
                                        300,000 Thomson's gazelle and Grant's gazelle,
                                        and tens of thousands of topi and Coke's hartebeest. Masai giraffe, waterbuck, impala, common warthog and hippopotamus are also abundant. 
                                        Some rarely seen species of antelope are also present in Serengeti National Park, such as common eland, klipspringer, roan antelope, bushbuck, lesser kudu,
                                        fringe-eared oryx and dik dik. Herds support 7,500 hyenas, 3,000 lions, and 250 cheetahs. There are more than 500 birds and 300 mammal species.

                                    The Munge Stream drains Olmoti Crater to the north, and is the main water source draining into the seasonal salt lake in the center of the crater. This lake is known by two names: Makat as the Maasai called it, meaning salt; and Magadi.
                                    The Lerai Stream drains the humid forests to the south of the Crater, and it feeds the Lerai Forest on the crater floor - when there is enough rain, the Lerai drains into Lake Magadi as well. Extraction of water by lodges and Ngorongoro
                                    Conservation Area headquarters reduces the amount of water entering Lerai by around 25%.
                                    The other major water source in the crater is the Ngoitokitok Spring, near the eastern crater wall. There is a picnic site here open to tourists and a huge swamp fed by the spring, and the area is inhabited by hippopotamus, elephants, lions and many others.
                                    Many other small springs can be found around the crater's floor, and these are important water supplies for the animals and local Maasai, especially during times of drought.
                                    Masai were previously permitted to graze their cattle within the crater, but as of 2015 were restricted from doing so.

                                    The area is named after Ngorongoro Crater (caldera), a large volcanic caldera within the area. The conservation area is administered by the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority, an arm of the Tanzanian government, and its boundaries follow the boundary of the Ngorongoro Division of the Arusha Region.
                                    The 2009 Ngorongoro Wildlife Conservation Act placed new restrictions on human settlement and subsistence farming in the Crater, displacing Maasai pastoralists, most of whom had been relocated to Ngorongoro from their ancestral lands to the north when the British colonial government established Serengeti National Park in 1959.

                                        The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Authority is the Ngorongoro Crater, the world's largest inactive, intact and unfilled volcanic caldera.The crater, which formed when a large volcano exploded and collapsed on itself two to three million years ago, is 610 metres (2,000 feet) deep and its floor covers 260 square 
                                        kilometres (100 square miles).Estimates of the height of the original volcano range from 4,500 to 5,800 metres (14,800 to 19,000 feet) high.
                                        The crater floor is 1,800 metres (5,900 feet) above sea level.The crater was voted by Seven Natural Wonders as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa in Arusha, Tanzania in February 2013.The Ngorongoro volcano was active from about 2.45 to 2 million years ago.
                                        The volcanic eruptions like that of Ngorongoro, which resulted in the formation of Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, were very common. Similar collapses occurred in the case of Olmoti and Empakaai, but they were much smaller in magnitude and impact.[citation needed]
                                        Out of the two recent volcanoes to the northeast of the Empakaai caldera, Kerimasi and Ol Doinyo Lengai, Doinyo Lengai is still active and had major eruptions in 2007 and 2008. Smaller ash eruptions and lava flows continue to slowly fill the current crater. Its name is Maasai language for ‘Mountain of God’.

                                    Perhaps the most popular animals among tourists are the Big Five, which include:
                                Lion: the Serengeti is believed to hold the largest lion population in Africa due in part to the abundance of prey species. More than 3,000 lions live in this ecosystem. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit together with Maasai Mara National Reserve and a lion stronghold in East Africa.[19]
                                African leopard: these reclusive predators are commonly seen in the Seronera region but are present throughout the national park with a population of around 1,000.
                                African bush elephant: the herds have recovered successfully from population lows in the 1980s caused by poaching, now numbering over 5,000 individuals, and are particularly numerous in the northern region of the park.
                                Eastern black rhinoceros: mainly found around the kopjes in the centre of the park, very few individuals remain due to rampant poaching. Individuals from the Maasai Mara Reserve cross the park border and enter Serengeti from the northern section at times. There is currently a small but stable population of 31 individuals left in the park.[22]
                                Cape buffalo: the most numerous of the Big Five, with around 53,000 individuals inside the park.

                                            Tarangire National Park is a national park in Tanzania's Manyara Region.
                                            The name of the park originates from the Tarangire River that crosses the park.
                                            The Tarangire River is the primary source of fresh water for wild animals in the Tarangire Ecosystem during the annual dry season.

                                                The Tarangire Ecosystem is defined by the long-distance migration of wildebeest and zebras.
                                                During the dry season thousands of animals concentrate in Tarangire National Park from the surrounding wet-season dispersal and calving areas.
                                                It covers an area of approximately 2,850 square kilometers (1,100 square miles.) The landscape is composed of granitic ridges, river valley, and swamps.
                                                 Vegetation is a mix of Acacia woodland, Combretum woodland, seasonally flooded grassland, and baobab trees.
